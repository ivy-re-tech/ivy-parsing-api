# Ivy Parsing API

This is an API wrapper around two of Datamade's parsing packages, and Libpostal:
 
* [probablepeople](https://github.com/datamade/probablepeople)
* [usaddress](https://github.com/datamade/usaddress)
* [libpostal](https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal)

It's built on [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) - a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework.

### Install

To run the service, you can call it directly from the terminal!

```
python main.py
```

For your convenience, or to deploy it alongside other services, you can use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

```
# prod
docker-compose up

# debug
DEBUG=yes docker-compose up
```

### Use

There are five endpoints:
* `GET /` - Healthcheck - returns `"pong""`.
* `GET /docs` - Autogenerated documentation in Swagger UI.
* `GET /address/<str>` - Split an address string into a dictionary of components.
* `GET /address/libpostal/<str>` - Split an address string into a dictionary of components using strictly `libpostal`.
* `GET /name/<str>` - Return an object representing the parsed name and any errors.

### Local Dev

You can use the Docker container with `docker-compose`!
If you want to run this locally for faster debugging and development (and response times), you'll need to install libpostal on your machine.
Then you can run `DEBUG=true python main.py`

### Test

Some minor testing can be done with the tests in `test/test_address.py`.
You can also manually test with the `test/localhost_parse_requests.http` request library.

### Build/Deploy

1. Ensure you have permission to push to gcr: `gcloud auth configure-docker`
2. From the project root: `deploy/build-deploy.sh <version>`

### Contribute

We welcome your contributions! Areas we need help:

1. Tests
2. Logging optimization and visibility from Docker
3. Documentation

Feel free to post Issues - that's also helpful!
